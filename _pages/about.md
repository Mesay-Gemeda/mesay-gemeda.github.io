I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science, supervised by Prof. Alexander Gelbukh and Prof. Olga Kolesnikova. My research focuses on NLP, with a specialization in multilingual hate speech detection in low-resource languages, LLMs, and explainable AI (XAI). I am passionate about leveraging machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based architectures to address challenges in low-resource language processing. I am a motivated individual with strong organizational, collaborative, and independent work skills.

Currently, my research work revolves around the development of LLM, and explainable AI (XAI). I am passionate about leveraging NLP technique, deep learning algorithms and transformer based architectures to tackle the challenges associated with identifying and combatting hate speech in diverse linguistic contexts.

Feel free to explore and learn more about my work in the field of NLP. If you have any questions, collaborations, or opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting!
