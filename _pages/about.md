I am a PhD student at the [Centro de Investigación en Computación (CIC), Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN)] in Mexico City(https://www.cic.ipn.mx/). My research interests primarily lie in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a specific focus on various topics including hate speech and online content verification (disinformation detection), language identification, machine translation, and text classification.

Currently, my research work revolves around the development of multilingual hate speech detection systems for low-resource languages. I am passionate about leveraging NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to tackle the challenges associated with identifying and combatting hate speech in diverse linguistic contexts.

Feel free to explore and learn more about my work in the field of NLP. If you have any questions, collaborations, or opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting!
